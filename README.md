# L-98-59-A-bright-M-Type-at-its-center-with-3-Earth-like-planet

This repository focuses on the planetary system **L 98-59**, which is centered on a bright M-type dwarf star. The system hosts three terrestrial planets, making it an exemplary target for studies of planet formation, orbital dynamics, and habitability around low-mass stars.

The code provided here facilitates the analysis of the stellar and planetary properties of the L 98-59 system, including photometric characterization, orbital parameter estimation, and potential habitability assessment. This framework is designed to support large-scale simulations and comparative studies of M-dwarf planetary systems.
