We noticed that one of our out parameters cells kept taking asignificant amount of time but due to us getting feedback on our preliminary report, we weren't ale to ask the questions needed.\n",

        "* There are multiple papers and equations that we will need to look at while we are sorting this out.\n",
        "* We were also thinking of finding the density of all te planets, then we can categorize what types of planets they are and compare to our own. This loks back to our original motivation of habitability. From this we could plot a graph of all known planet masses and see where ours lies.\n",
